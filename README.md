## About me

My name is Ondřej. I am a grammar school student from the Czech
Republic. I really like computers, the Rust programming language,
mathematics, physics, and the like.

## My favourite software

I use Emacs as my text editor. I've recently switched from Neovim
after about two years, and I'm really starting to like it.

The rest is not that interesting, but I do run the [Void GNU/Linux
distribution](https://voidlinux.org) on my laptop. It is a
Wayland-only setup, which I try to keep relatively minimal (I do use
Emacs, though).
