## About me

My name is Ondřej. I am a grammar school student from the Czech
Republic. I really like computers, the Rust programming language,
mathematics, physics, and the like.

## My favourite software

All of my editing is done in Neovim. It's the piece of software in
which I do my coding, writing, and all other kinds of editing.

The rest is not that interesting, but I do run the [Void GNU/Linux
distribution](https://voidlinux.org) on my laptop. It is a
Wayland-only setup, which I try to keep relatively minimal.
